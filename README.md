# Word-Guessing-Game
A simple word guessing game written in Ruby which grabs a random word and definition from www.randomword.com

The game works by telling the user they have 3 attempts to correctly guess a word.

The user is given a short definition of the word, as well as a number of hint letters depending on the length of the word.

If the player guesses the word correctly, they are informed that they win!

If the player guesses the word incorrectly, they are given some more hint letters to help them in their future guesses.
